## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

In this project we present YOLO v3, a new approach to object detection. YOLO can be expanded as You Only Look Once.
The prior work on object detection was carried out as a two-step process. They first generate a potential bounding box in an image and then use a classifier on those boxes.
After classification, post-processing is used to refine the bounding boxes, eliminate duplicate detections and rescore the boxes based on the other objects in the scene. 
These methods are complex and are time-consuming. Also, they are hard to train and optimize because each individual component must be trained separately.
YOLO eliminates these problems by carrying out the whole detection process in a single pipeline.
As its name suggests, uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation .
This project describes the procedure of bird detection and classification using YOLO v3 , inferences from training.
